I recently experienced a career change, as I was unfortunately made redundant in October 2022. Instead of jumping into another role right away, I took the opportunity to focus on my health and reevaluate my priorities. I wanted to take a step back and think about where I am now and where I want to be going forward.

Now, with my priorities in order, I am excited to apply what I’ve learned to new opportunities and projects. I am also looking forward to giving talks and workshops again and sharing my knowledge and experiences with others.

## Things I'm learning right now
- My [personal blog](https://izabelacborges.github.io) is a recent project into learning Golang, the Hugo framework and getting a refresh of some web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- Strengthening my base of machine learning algorithms following the Machine Learning Specialization on [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
- Diving into Data Engineering and the design of data pipelines

⚡  **Main skills used at the moment:**
Python | PySpark | Java | Go | Docker | Kubernetes

- 💬  Fun fact: being a DM for TTRPGs and writing fiction was one of the most useful things when improving my data storytelling
- 🔖  Need git tips fast? Go look at [GitFichas](https://gitfichas.com/) from [@jtemporal](https://github.com/jtemporal) (🇧🇷  Portuguese only resource)
- 👶🏽  Pronouns: they/them/she/her
