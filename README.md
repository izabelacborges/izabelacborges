I'm a Data Scientist with interest in developing projects that promote positive impact on our society. Far from doing cool things with lots of data, I want to make the lives of people in my community better, using those lots of data.

I also love teaching what I can to other people interested in tech, and in the past few years I've been focused on giving talks and classes about programming logic, the Python language, machine learning, git and open source initiatives.

Right now I'm based in Brazil and I'm currently working at iFood, the lead company in the food delivery segment in Latin America. But previous to that, I not only worked in the data and artificial intelligence scene, but I started with QA & DevOps, what I believe helped me a lot with developing more reliable and robust solutions.

- 🔭 I’m currently focused on working with huge datasets, producing solutions based on eating habits and food culture (human quirks around and about food are indeed pretty interesting!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about AWS workflows and architecture
- ⚡ Main skills used at the moment:
  - Python | PySpark | R | Go | SageMaker | Data Storytelling

- 💬 Fun fact: being a DM for TTRPGs and writing fiction was one of the most useful things when improving my data storytelling
- 👶🏽 Pronouns: she/her/they/them
